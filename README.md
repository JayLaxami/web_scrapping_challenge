# web_scrapping_challenge

In part 1:

Mars_news (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) website is scrapped and text elements are extracted.

Loop the text elements and extract the title and preview text from elements.

In part 2:

Mars_weather (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html) is scrapped and analyzed.

All rows of data is extracted.

Loop through the scraped data to create a list of rows.

Pandas DataFrame by using the list of rows and a list of the column names is created.

Data types for data analysis is changed accordingly.

Data analysis is performed.

The average temperature by month is plotted.

On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the warmest. But it is always very cold there in human terms!


The average pressure by month is plotted.

Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth.

Terrestrial (earth) days are found by plotting.

The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
